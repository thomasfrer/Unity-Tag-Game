**The Artifact**

This is a small tag-type game I made in Unity as a mini project with a few goals in mind to accomplish; such as a first-to-third-person camera switcher, a minimap, and an AI with navigation. All of the assets used are free on the Unity marketplace or are from Mixamo.
The goal of the game is to collect 5 artifacts without getting caught by the alien insects on the ship with you. Thanks for checking out the project.

You can download the game here!
